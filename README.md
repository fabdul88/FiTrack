# FiTrack

This react application was created to help people during the pandemic, by defining their own fitness workouts, with an intention of helping users keep up with their mental and physical health.

Some Key Aspects:

- Automatic form redirecting upon submission of user data.
- Shows the users workout goals in a list format.
- Shows the Username, description of the workout, duration of the workout in minutes, the date the workout is intended to be performed, and an actions category, to either edit or delete the workout.

Deployed live on [Heroku](https://fitrack-mern.herokuapp.com/)

**Note:** Free tier version of Heroku takes some time to start up the live project.
